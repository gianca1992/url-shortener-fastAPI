# url-shortener-fastAPI

This pyhon app uses FastAPI, Uvicorn as web Server and SQL Alchemy as DB to implement a local url shortener. 

The python code was grabbed from https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/fastapi-url-shortener/source_code_final/shortener_app

I have written a Dockerfile and made it available in this repo along with the python code and I will show a step-by step guide to dockerise the app and to deploy it on AWS using Terraform. 

When the main.tf file is invoked, some AWS infrastructure is automatically deployed and then the pull-run-shortener.sh is triggered to install docker, pull the image from the docker registry and instanciate a container where the url shortener app is running on an EC2 instance.  

In order for Terraform to interact with AWS, you need and AWS free tier account, an AWS programmatic access key and a key pair to interact with the EC2 instance. 



###  A 
Install docker locally, clone the repo, cd to the root dir where Dockerfile dir resides, edit the Dockerfile as needed and when you are ready

### B 
Build the image locally:

```
docker build -t url-shortener-giancarlo . 

```

Run a container from it to test locally: 

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 url-shortener-giancarlo
```

You should see something like:

```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
run ```curl localhost:8000``` to see a test message, 

```
"Hello from the URL shortener FastAPI python app"
```

### C 
Create an account in dockerhub, create a repository, name it for example "repo-for-shortener"

Tag the image and then push it to your dockerhub repository:

```
docker tag url-shortener-giancarlo:latest your-dockerhub-username/repo-for-shortener

docker push your-dockerhub-username/repo-for-shortener

```

### D 
Set up a CLI programmatic access key from AWS, create a key pair from AWS, name it key_pair.pem. This will be used by terraform to deploy the app on an EC2 instance by leveraging the shell script

### E
Launch the terrafrom commands locally by replacing your programmatic access credentials: 

```
terraform init 
terraform plan -var 'aws_access_key=XXXXXX' -var 'aws_secret_key=XXXXXXX' 
terraform apply -var 'aws_access_key=XXXXXX' -var 'aws_secret_key=XXXXXXX' 
```

### F
You can ssh into the ec2 instance to test the application: 

```
ssh -i ~/Path/to/key/key_pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-XXX-XXX-XXX.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

You can see if the docker image is running with: 

```
sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
XXXXXXX   your-dockerhub-username/repo-for-shortener:latest   "/bin/sh -c 'python â€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp   modest_sinoussi


curl localhost:8000
"Hello from the URL shortener FastAPI python app"

```


### G  
Send a POST request via CURL populating the target_url with the url you want to shorten, for example let's use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM  
```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-242 ~]$ curl -X 'POST'   'http://0.0.0.0:8000/url'   -H 'accept: application/json'   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d '{
  "target_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM"}'
 ```
 
 You will get in response the shortened link, for example in my case http://localhost:8000/DI9LL

```
 {"target_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM","is_active":true,"clicks":0,"url":"http://localhost:8000/DI9LL","admin_url":"http://localhost:8000/admin/DI9LL_B01AFMEA"}
 
 ```

### H 
You can test them with "curl -L http://localhost:8000/DI9LL" and " curl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM"
